Live Deploy Link: https://sanberk-platesco.netlify.app

This project is a proof of concept for Plates Co’s new sales system. It is a web-based application that allows users to add products to their basket, view the total cost, and apply special offers and delivery charges.

## Features

	•	Add products to the basket
	•	View the total cost of the basket
	•	Apply special offers
	•	Calculate and apply delivery charges
	•	Remove individual items from the basket
	•	Clear the entire basket

## Assumptions

	•	The product catalog is predefined and includes three products: Red Plate, Green Plate, and Blue Plate.
	•	Special offers and delivery rules are hardcoded into the system.
	•	The special offer applies only to Red Plates: buy one Red Plate, get the second half price.
	•	Delivery charges are calculated as follows:
	•	Orders under $50 cost $4.95.
	•	Orders between $50 and $89.99 cost $2.95.
	•	Orders of $90 or more have free delivery.
